<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm IanSkinner1982, the developer of <a href="https://github.com/IanSkinner1982?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=" target="_blank">a few C64 apps</a> and a member of <a href="https://github.com/NCX-Programming">NCX-Programming</a>. I helped create some of this website, as well as <a href=/site/programs/ncxnewsplus>NCX-News+</a>.<br><h4>Facts:</h4>The 1982 in my name comes from the year the Commodore 64 was released.<br>I was <i>not</i> born in 1982. (when my pfp wasn't my face, a lot of people thought that)<br>The C64 is my favorite computer.</p>
<h3>Stuff I've made</h3>
<p>Try my software with the emulator below. Please be patient as it is loading the disk about as slow as a normal C64. (It might be faster. I haven't compared them)</p>
