<h1>Welcome to the NCX Programming website. Enjoy your stay.</h1>
<h3>So, what is this site? (And why does it have no style??)</h3>
<p>Basically, I suck at web design. So to compensate, I've built an <i>extremely</i> basic website to talk about my projects, as well as to host my blog type thing where I talk about random tech stuff that I've done.</p>
